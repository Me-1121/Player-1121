At competition, every team has a pit. Decorate it! Display your boards! Bring an extension cord for charging your bot. 

Put together an emergency kit of extra cords, Legos, and batteries to bring to competition. 

Most events will have lunch available for pre-order. Very convenient. Make sure that parents know how lunch works and that they are to feed themselves; children cannot leave the event. 

When judging rooms are very close, there are callbacks. Team goes back with "stuff" and answers with additional questions. 

Always have fully charged batteries - we will be getting new batteries.
