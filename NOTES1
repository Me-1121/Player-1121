At competition, every team has a pit. Decorate it! Display your boards! Bring an extension cord for charging your bot. 

Put together an emergency kit of extra cords, Legos, and batteries to bring to competition. 

Most events will have lunch available for pre-order. Very convenient. Make sure that parents know how lunch works and that they are to feed themselves; children cannot leave the event. 

When judging rooms are very close, there are callbacks. Team goes back with "stuff" and answers with additional questions. 

Always have fully charged batteries - we will be getting new batteries.

You cannot have the wifi or bluetooth on during competition - other people could try and control it.

You can use Github to upload your code and save it on the web - this account is secure, and no one else can see it.

In order to prevent your robot to not have gyro drift, use ramp up/ramp down

Gyro drift is when your robot it jerked around and looses position. This typically happens when you set your robot to go fast to start, and it jerks.
